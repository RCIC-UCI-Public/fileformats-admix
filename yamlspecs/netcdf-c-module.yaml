  description: |
    The Unidata network Common Data Form (netCDF) is an interface for scientific data
    access and freely-distributed software libraries that provide an implementaion of
    the interface.  The netCDF  library also defines a machine-independent format for
    representing scientific data. Together, the interface, library, and format support
    the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.
    The current netCDF software provides
        netcdf-c version {{versions.netcdfc}} for C interfaces
        netcdf-fortran version {{versions.netcdff}} for FORTRAN interfaces
